You\u2019ll then be shown a asking you to put in the last password you can remember. If you can remember a correct password and you have a backup system set up, you\u2019ll then be asked to continue in a variety of ways. If you can\u2019t remember any of them, click \u201ctry a different question.\u201d The next option will be sending a code to a recovery email, which rather presumes that you have a secondary recovery email (which you set up way back when you created your Gmail account in the first place). Using this option will send you a link at your secondary email account (which doesn\u2019t need to be Gmail), with a 6-digit code that will allow you to set up a new password and regain access to your account. Check your mail on this secondary account to see the code, then enter it to unlock a new password generator. Newer accounts may also have a phone number backup option\u2014see below. If that doesn\u2019t work\u2014like, say, you don\u2019t have access to the account that you originally designated as a backup either\u2014click \u201ctry a different question\u201d again. Now we\u2019re getting into older, less secure methods of account protection, like security questions such as \u201cwhat\u2019s your mother\u2019s maiden name.\u201d You should be able to answer at least one of these.",

                "answer": "There are a number of things you can do: Write it down.It should be the only thing on the paper, do not include your username. When writing down a password you should obfuscate it in some fashion, such as adding characters to it or taking characters out so that someone who sees it will have a hard time guessing your password. Once you\u2019ve written it down you should store it in a safe place like a locked drawer. After you have memorized your password you should destroy the paper so that the password only exists in your head. Type it thirty (30) times in a row.Typing your password thirty times will help you commit it to muscle memory.Chose not to have applications save your password.By choosing not to have applications save your password you will force yourself to type your password more often. This will improve your ability to remember your password.",

The strongest approaches use PKI cryptography where the private key is stored on a smart card and never leaves the smart card, and where it is extremely difficult, given the smart card to be able to clone it quickly.\n\nYou don't necessarily need this Rolls Royce physical factor approach though. All forms of physical factor are pretty good. Sending a one-time-password to a phone via SMS is great for most applications and at a totally different level in terms of security compared to logonid and password.\n\nThe most secure approach for authentication however will come when we the users are allowed to choose the authentication provider we want to use for every site we visit. Of course there will be minimum requirements. On a bank site our authentication provider will have to support \"strong\" authentication and also in future digital signing of transactions. This brave new world is referred to as federated authentication. The U.S. Government led NSTIC is trying to stimulate federated authentication and the wider topic of federated identity adoption.",

Password reuse is the worst thing you can do when it comes to passwords.If you used the same password for your bank as you do for some random site, the password is only as strong as the weakest link. If that no name site gets breached so can your bank account. The reason why it\u2019s safe to write down your master password is due to the threat model.

                "answer": "1.\nUnderstand the need for an antivirus program. Windows is the most virus-prone operating system (OS) out of the three major OSes. It has the most users and the weakest built-in security. Antivirus programs will defend your computer from malware that comes through email, flash drives, downloads, websites and more.\n2. \nAcquire an antivirus program. There are several popular free options available that do a good job of protecting the average user. These programs are updated frequently with new virus definitions that recognize the latest threats.[1]\nIf you frequently deal with files or websites that are virus-infected, you may want to opt for more powerful paid protection. Paid antivirus programs are typically available for a yearly subscription fee.\nWhen downloading free or paid antivirus programs, ensure that you are downloading from a trusted source. There are many programs out there that claim to be antivirus/antimalware but instead install malware themselves. Read reviews and download products from companies that have been around for a long time.[2]\nWindows 10 and 8 have Windows Defender, which is a free anti-malware application provided by Microsoft. It's already built-in.\n3. \nInstall the antivirus program. Make sure that no other programs are running while you install the antivirus. You will most likely need to be connected to the internet to download additional files and updates.\nSome free antivirus programs come packaged with toolbars for your web browser. These can add protection but also change your search options and bog down older computers. You have the opportunity to opt out of these changes during the installation process.",

This blocks phone numbers that you've never been in contact with and don\u2019t have saved in your contacts list.

Calls from unknown numbers are silenced and sent to your voicemail, and appear in your recent calls list.\nIncoming calls will come through from people that are saved in your contacts list, recent calls list, and from Siri Suggestions to let you know who\u2019s calling based on phone numbers included in your emails or text messages.\nIf an emergency call is placed, Silence Unknown Callers will be temporarily disabled for the next 24 hours to allow for your iPhone to be reached.\nBefore you turn on Silence Unknown Callers, make sure you have important contacts saved or you could miss a phone call that you don\u2019t want to miss. The call will still go to voicemail and appear in your recent calls list, but you won\u2019t get a notification while the call is ringing.\n\n3.

                "answer": "Keep your computers and mobile devices up to date. Having the latest security software, web browser, and operating system are the best defenses against viruses, malware, and other online threats. Turn on automatic updates so you receive the newest fixes as they become available.\nSet strong passwords. A strong password is at least eight characters in length and includes a mix of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.\nWatch out for phishing scams. Phishing scams use fraudulent emails and websites to trick users into disclosing private account or login information. Do not click on links or open any attachments or pop-up screens from sources you are not familiar with. Forward phishing emails to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at spam@uce.gov \u2013 and to the company, bank, or organization impersonated in the email.\nKeep personal information personal. Hackers can use social media profiles to figure out your passwords and answer those security questions in the password reset tools. Lock down your privacy settings and avoid posting things like birthdays, addresses, mother\u2019s maiden name, etc. Be wary of requests to connect from people you do not know.\nSecure your internet connection. Always protect your home wireless network with a password. When connecting to public Wi-Fi networks, be cautious about what information you are sending over it.\nShop safely. Before shopping online, make sure the website uses secure technology. When you are at the checkout screen, verify that the web address begins with https. Also, check to see if a tiny locked padlock symbol appears on the page.\nRead the site\u2019s privacy policies. Though long and complex, privacy policies tell you how the site protects the personal information it collects. If you don\u2019t see or understand a site\u2019s privacy policy, consider doing business elsewhere.\n",

Dust or fluff is enough to block the port from recognizing your headphones or speakers. Try blowing the dust off the jack and from inside the port on your Mac to see if that solves the problem.\n- Plug the headphones back in while holding the volume buttons at the same time.\n- Check the volume controls on your headphones. Some models have built-in volume controls that can be turned down or turned off.\n- Check all of the ports by disconnecting everything plugged into your Mac. That includes HDMI, Thunderbolt, and USB devices. Other devices could be channeling the sound away from your headphones. If your TV is connected via HDMI, for example, your sound is probably being redirected to the TV instead of the headphones or speakers.\n- If you want the sound to play through your headphones or speakers while your TV is on, you need to switch to your speakers by clicking on the audio icon found in the Mac menu bar. Select your headphones/speakers there.\n- Restart your Mac.\n- Restart your sound controller by opening the \u201cActivity Monitor\u201d and locating \u201ccoreaudiod\u201d in the process list.

                    "Mouse wheel not scrolling"
                ],
                "w_answer": "1. Reconnect the mouse. Before doing anything, make sure the issue isn't a temporary one. You can do this by disconnecting the mouse from the USB port and plugging it back in. Whenever you plug in a mouse, it restarts the mouse drivers and this alone could resolve the issue. You might even try using a different USB port. If you're using a wireless mouse, make sure you've connected it properly to your PC.\n2. Replace the batteries. If you're using a wireless mouse, low battery power is the most common cause of strange mouse behavior. Whether the mouse wheel isn't scrolling or the mouse is otherwise acting erratically, swapping the batteries is a very quick and inexpensive way to rule out this cause.\n3. You might also consider switching to rechargeable batteries so that you can always have fully charged batteries on hand that you swap out on a schedule. This way you don't have to wait until your mouse starts acting up before changing them.\n4. Clean the mouse. Most modern mice don't have rollers to clean anymore, but now the scroll wheel is the one mechanical part. This also means it's the part prone to attracting dirt, dust, and food particles. These slip in through the cracks on the side of the wheel and can lead to the mouse scroll wheel not working. If your mouse is wireless, there are some special wireless mouse cleaning considerations to keep in mind.\n5. Check the touchpad. Another common issue is mouse interference from something touching the touchpad on your laptop. This could be something as simple as water leaking from a cup nearby. You might even consider temporarily disabling your touchpad just to see if this fixes the problem.\n6. Check mouse wheel settings. Each OS has unique settings to control the mouse wheel. If these change you could experience the mouse wheel not scrolling. Look through your mouse settings on your Windows 10 to ensure wheel scrolling is actually enabled and configured properly.\n7. Update mouse drivers. The most effective way to update your mouse driver is to download and install the latest mouse driver from the manufacturer's website. On a Windows 10 PC, check the Device Manager to ensure there isn't an exclamation mark next to the mouse driver after you've updated. If there is, you'll want to roll back the mouse driver and try something else.\nNote: Before moving on to the final step, try using a different mouse to make sure that the issue is actually with your system and not a mouse hardware failure. You wouldn't want to take more drastic measures with your computer if all you need is to buy a new mouse.\n8. Fix corrupt system files. At this point, it is possible your system files may be corrupt. Before you try anything drastic, make sure you've installed the latest system updates for Windows 10. Next, try to perform an automatic repair for Windows 10. If all else fails, you may need to do a full Windows 10 system restore or a clean install of Windows if you don't have a recovery backup.",
                "m_answer": "1. Reconnect the mouse. Before doing anything, make sure the issue isn't a temporary one. You can do this by disconnecting the mouse from the USB port and plugging it back in. Whenever you plug in a mouse, it restarts the mouse drivers and this alone could resolve the issue. You might even try using a different USB port. If you're using a wireless mouse, make sure you've connected it properly to your PC.\n2. Replace the batteries. If you're using a wireless mouse, low battery power is the most common cause of strange mouse behavior. Whether the mouse wheel isn't scrolling or the mouse is otherwise acting erratically, swapping the batteries is a very quick and inexpensive way to rule out this cause.\n3. You might also consider switching to rechargeable batteries so that you can always have fully charged batteries on hand that you swap out on a schedule. This way you don't have to wait until your mouse starts acting up before changing them.\n4. Clean the mouse. Most modern mice don't have rollers to clean anymore, but now the scroll wheel is the one mechanical part. This also means it's the part prone to attracting dirt, dust, and food particles. These slip in through the cracks on the side of the wheel and can lead to the mouse scroll wheel not working. If your mouse is wireless, there are some special wireless mouse cleaning considerations to keep in mind.\n5. Check the touchpad. Another common issue is mouse interference from something touching the touchpad on your laptop. This could be something as simple as water leaking from a cup nearby. You might even consider temporarily disabling your touchpad just to see if this fixes the problem.\n6. Check mouse wheel settings. Each OS has unique settings to control the mouse wheel. If these change you could experience the mouse wheel not scrolling. Look through your mouse settings on your Mac to ensure wheel scrolling is actually enabled and configured properly. Also check that the scrolling direction is set up the way you want it to be.\n7. Update mouse drivers. The most effective way to update your mouse driver is to download and install the latest mouse driver from the manufacturer's website.\nNote: Before moving on to the final step, try using a different mouse to make sure that the issue is actually with your system and not a mouse hardware failure. You wouldn't want to take more drastic measures with your computer if all you need is to buy a new mouse.\n8. Fix corrupt system files. At this point, it is possible your system files may be corrupt. Before you try anything drastic, make sure you've installed the latest system updates for Mac OS from the Apple App Store. If all else fails, you may need to do a full Mac OS re-install.",

                "m_answer": "The Battery Status menu on your Mac notebook might say \u201cNot Charging,\u201d even if it\u2019s connected to power. This can happen for a few reasons:\n\n- Your computer temporarily paused charging to extend the life of your battery. Your battery may drain to 90% or lower before it begins charging again. To immediately resume charging, you can turn off battery health management in Energy Saver preferences. See the Apple Support article About battery health management in Mac notebooks.\n- Your computer is connected to a power source that gives it enough power to run, but not enough power to charge the battery. For example, your Mac might not charge when it\u2019s connected to a low wattage adapter. You can still use your Mac without draining its battery, but the battery won\u2019t charge, even if you turn off your Mac or put it to sleep.\n- Your computer is running at a very high performance level that uses more power than the power source provides. For example, some apps\u2014such as video editing software and video games\u2014can require more power and drain the battery more quickly.",

So when the sound suddenly gets louder, we assume that it\u2019s from the hard drive.\nTo check this, you can simply unplug the power and data cables from the hard drive and reboot the system. If you still hear the sound, the issue is not with the hard drive.\n\n2. Run a diagnostic software\nIf you\u2019re certain that the sound comes from the hard drive itself, you can run a free hardware diagnostic software which is already available on many computers or available on the internet.\n\n3. Replace the hard drive\nIf the diagnostic software fails, it simply means there is an issue related to the hardware of the drive. If in that case, there is nothing you can do except to replace it.\nRemember to make a back up of your files before replacing it.",
                "m_answer": "The most common reason of noise are fans running at full speed due to air vents being blocked. If you\u2019re using your Mac on your lap or on a soft surface like a bed or blanket then the fans may just be working harder to try to push out the hot air. Move the Mac to a hard surface and see if the fans become quieter after a few minutes.\n\nIf one of your Mac\u2019s temperature sensors is flaky or giving erroneous data then the controller chip might make the fans run at full speed even though the Mac\u2019s temperature is in the normal range. Restarting your Mac could reset the temperature sensor so give that a try. If that doesn\u2019t help then you could reset the SMC using Apple\u2019s instructions.\n\nIf your fans are still loud then let\u2019s use the Activity Monitor to see if any application or process is making your Mac\u2019s processor work hard. Go to your Applications folder, locate the Utilities folder and double-click Activity Monitor to open it. Click on the CPU tab and then % CPU column, as depicted in the image below, to put the items using the greatest percentage of the CPU\u2019s ability at the top of the list.

Today\u2019s machines are just as prone to pressure- and moisture-induced mechanical errors as their 5- or even 10-year-old ancestors were.",

                    ""
                ],
                "w_answer": "1. Open Start Image titled Windowsstart.png. Click the Windows logo in the bottom-left corner of the screen.\n2. Open System Information. Type msinfo into the Start window, then click System Information at the top of the Start window.\n3. Check your computer's model name. Next to the \"System Model\" heading, you'll see a list of numbers and letters; this is your computer's model name. You'll need this information when you search for the BIOS update file.\n-Skip this step if you have a custom-built computer. \n4. Find your BIOS version number. Next to the \"BIOS Version/Date\" heading, you'll see a company name, your computer's model name, and a number after a period. The number after the period is your BIOS version.\nFor a computer with the model number \"Q553UB\" and a BIOS set to version 202, for example, you would see \"Q553UB.202\" here.\nIf you're using a custom-built computer, you'll need to find your motherboard's model instead of using the computer's model number. \n5. Open your BIOS manufacturer's support site. Generally, the easiest way to do this is by typing your computer's manufacturer name, your computer's model name, and \"drivers\" or \"BIOS\" into Google and then selecting the proper link. This process will vary depending on your computer's manufacturer, so you may have to click through a few different links before you find the correct one.\nIf you're using a custom-built computer, you'll need to look up your computer's motherboard name along with \"BIOS\" and \"update\" and then open the manufacturer's website. \n6. Find the BIOS update file. Depending on the website, you may have to open the \"Updates\", \"Support\", or \"Downloads\" section first, or click a \"BIOS\" heading. Once you've found the BIOS file, you can proceed.\nAgain, this may involve some trial and error. \n7. Make sure the update file is newer than your BIOS version. In the file's name, you should see a version number. If this version number is higher than your BIOS version number, your BIOS is outdated and thus can be updated.\nIf the version number on the website matches your BIOS version number, your BIOS is up-to-date and does not need updating.\nEven if your current BIOS version is a whole number (e.g., 301) and the file on the site is listed as a higher decimal (e.g., 301.1), the site's file is a higher version than your BIOS uses. \n8. Download the update file. Click the Download link, button, or icon to do so. Once your BIOS update file finishes downloading, you can proceed with updating your BIOS.\nIn some cases, you may have to click the file's name to prompt it to download.\nMost BIOS update files will download inside of a ZIP folder. \n9. Make sure your computer is plugged into a reliable power source. Since you can permanently ruin your BIOS if your computer turns itself off during the update process, you'll want to use a reliable power source.\nIf you're using a laptop, your computer's battery should be fully charged in addition to the laptop being plugged in. \n10. Extract your BIOS file. In most cases, you'll have to extract (or \"unzip\") the BIOS update file from within its folder:\nDouble-click the downloaded ZIP file to open it.\nClick the Extract tab at the top of the window.\nClick Extract all.\nClick Extract when prompted.\nWait for the extracted folder to open. \n11. Read your BIOS file's README document if applicable. If a text document labeled \"README\" or similar is available, double-click it to open it and read the entire document before proceeding.\nIf the README file's instructions for updating your BIOS contradict the instructions in the rest of this article, make sure you follow the README's instructions instead. \n12. Plug a USB flash drive into your computer. Since your BIOS won't be able to access your computer's files, you'll need to put the BIOS update file on a blank USB flash drive \n13. Copy the BIOS file onto the flash drive. Click once the BIOS file, press Ctrl+C to copy it, then open your flash drive and press Ctrl+V to paste in your copied file.\nYou need to leave the flash drive plugged into your computer for the duration of the update process. \n6. Access the BIOS page. Prompt your computer to restart by clicking Start Image titled Windowsstart.png, clicking Power Image titled Windowspower.png, and clicking Restart, then immediately begin pressing the key your computer's manufacturer assigned to the BIOS startup. If the BIOS doesn't launch, you'll need to restart again and try a different key.\nFor most computers, this key is one of the function keys (e.g., F12), though some computers use the Del key or the Esc key.\nIf you don't know your computer's BIOS key, look it up by typing your computer's manufacturer name, model name, and \"BIOS key\" into a search engine. \n14. Back up your BIOS if possible. If you see a \"Backup\" or \"Save\" option on the BIOS' main screen (or if you see a Backup tab at the top of the screen), select it and follow any on-screen instructions. This will ensure that you can restore your BIOS settings later if your BIOS update doesn't pair well with your computer.\nYou may instead be prompted to back up your BIOS once you initiate the backup process.\nNot all BIOS pages allow you to back up their settings. \n15. Enable and use your BIOS update tool. Each BIOS will have a slightly different way of accessing the BIOS update tool, so you may have to consult your BIOS manufacturer's support site for a direct explanation of how to do so.\nIn many cases, you'll select the Boot tab, ensure that your USB flash drive shows up, enable any backup or \"Flash\" options in the menu, and then select the Start Flash option from the Advanced tab.[1]\nSometimes, pressing the BIOS key while a USB drive is plugged in will bring up a unique menu that allows you to select an Update option and follow the on-screen instructions. This is common on Dell computers.[2] \n16. Allow your computer's BIOS to update. This process can take a few minutes to over an hour depending on your computer and the depth of the BIOS update. Once your BIOS is finished updating, your computer should restart itself, though you may be prompted to confirm this decision.\nDo not turn off your computer while the BIOS is updating. Doing so can cause the BIOS to become corrupted, meaning that your computer will be unable to start, complete the BIOS installation, or otherwise run at all.",
